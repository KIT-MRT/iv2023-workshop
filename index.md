title: 'From Benchmarking Behavior Prediction to Socially Compatible Behavior Generation in Autonomous Driving'
excerpt: 'An IV2022 workshop.'
---

This workshop will be held at the [33rd IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)](https://iv2022.com), on June 5th, 2022, in Aachen, Germany in the afternoon. 

Location: Eurogress, Conference Room 2, Sunday 13:00h CEST

## Scope and Topics

Research on Automated Vehicles enabled safe prototypes, driving in public traffic. However, safety comes at the price of overly conservative inconvenient behavior, e.g. in unprotected left turns or merging scenarios. Reasons can include prediction errors in **vehicle interactions** or lack of probabilistic considerations in motion planning. While it must be ensured that safe and possibly uncomfortable reactions to worst-case behaviors of others remain feasible, the intended reaction should be comfortable. 


Approaches providing sufficient and comfortable actions require **sophisticated behavior prediction for other traffic participants**. Predictions with maneuver options for other vehicles are needed, which cannot be evaluated against one single “right prediction”. Options may depend on destinations, driving styles and even emotions. Novel methods, not limited to machine learning or common evaluation schemes, are needed. 


Similarly, motion planning in highly interactive scenarios lacks one single “ground truth”. In public traffic, a good plan should lead to **stereotypical behavior, predictable by other road users**. It's realization requires research on the combination of planning and prediction and its **evaluation and benchmarking**. 


The organizers support research with the published INTERACTION dataset [https://interaction-dataset.com/](https://interaction-dataset.com/) of trajectory data from highly interactive traffic scenarios on high-definition maps but all contributions within the scope of the workshop are welcome, with or without use of the dataset.
